# Generator-Guided-Synthetic-Speech-for-Robust-Deepfake-Detection
Combination of real and synthetic speech data allows evaluation on ASVspoof and related benchmarks for generalization and explainability. Expected outcomes include improved robustness, cross-generator consistency, and interpretable reasoning for spoof identification.
